# Classify This Video Game!


This project was created for #SchoolofAIVancouver Image Classification Code Challenge 2. This image classification code tries to classify paintings into 3 classes:

* First Person Shooter(FPS)

![FPS](/images/fps.jpg "FPS")

* Real Time Strategy(RTS)

![RTS](/images/rts.jpg "RTS")


* Sports(SPT)

![SPT](/images/spt.jpg "SPT")




## Getting Started

You can clone the repo to retrain and test the model. However please not that there arent any 'train', 'validate' or 'test' data in this repo. It has been removed to avoid uploading all the images to git.

### Prerequisites

You will need the data which you can get using the `video_game_classify.ipynb`





## Built With

* [Google Colaboratory](https://collab.research.google,com)- Free Jupyter notebook enviroment hosted in the cloud. Developed by Google.
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/about/) - The programming language used
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - Keras: A high-level neural networks API running TensorFlow

## Known Bugs

There are *No* known bugs in the `video_game_classify.ipynb`


## Disclaimer

The trained model in this image classifier is not perfect! The data used in this project was scraped from the Internet(Youtube). The dataset has not gone through rigorous data cleaning or parameter tuning techniques and there maybe some false positives during the labelling test. Feel free to retrain the model with a more accurate dataset.
